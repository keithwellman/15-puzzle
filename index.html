      <h1>Fifteen Puzzle</h1>
      <p>
        The goal of the fifteen puzzle is to un-jumble its fifteen squares by repeatedly making moves that slide squares into the empty space. How quickly can you solve it?

      <p>
        American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle was actually created around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York.
